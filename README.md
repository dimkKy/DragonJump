### Notes and compatibility
**C++20** compatible compiler is required. <br />
I'm not sure if I legally allowed to share dlls, so they will not be provided. <br />
This solution is rushed and badly designed. In particular, there are no exception guarantees, dynamic polymorphism overuse (should have used CRTPs), and it is bloated. Beyond refactoring. <br />

### Features
* Physics-driven character movement;
* Physics framerate independence with sub-stepping;
* Fully functional collision system;
* Fully functional buttons;
* Automatic memory management using smart pointers;
